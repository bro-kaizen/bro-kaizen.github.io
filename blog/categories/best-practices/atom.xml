    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wiser and more experienced writers than Bro Kaizen are considering Deliberate Practice, about which I began <a href="(/blog/2014/11/14/deliberate-practice/)">harping</a> earlier this week. Here’s perhaps the pithiest example of DP I’ve ever heard described—this is the whole thing in a nutshell.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><blockquote><p>Consider the activity of two basketball players practicing free throws for one hour. Player A shoots 200 practice shots, Player B shoots 50. The Player B retrieves his own shots, dribbles leisurely and takes several breaks to talk to friends. Player A has a colleague who retrieves the ball after each attempt. The colleague keeps a record of shots made. If the shot is missed the colleague records whether the miss was short, long, left or right and the shooter reviews the results after every 10 minutes of practice. To characterize their hour of practice as equal would hardly be accurate. Assuming this is typical of their practice routine and they are equally skilled at the start, which would you predict would be the better shooter after only 100 hours of practice?</p><footer><strong>—Aubrey Daniels</strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>The quote is brazenly stolen from <a href="http://aubreydaniels.com/pmezine/expert-performance-apologies-dr-ericsson-it-not-10000-hours-deliberate-practice">here</a>. What could I possibly add to that? </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’re overweight, you don’t earn physical fitness by spending three days doing a cardio circuit with your roomate, two days following a diet that your girlfriend invented, four days with Mark Rippetoe’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rippetoe">Starting Strength</a>, and then going to sit on the couch. A piecemeal (and half-heartedly implemented) approach like that is <strong>destined to fail.</strong> </p>

<!--more-->

<p>A much better approach is “deliberate practice,” a term that I have shamelessly stolen from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Colvin">Geoff Colvin</a>, <a href="http://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice">James Clear</a>, and <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2010/11/07/the-secret-of-great-men-deliberate-practice/">others</a>. </p>

<p>Deliberate practice has been exhaustively defined and elaborated upon elsewhere (there are literally books written on the topic—follow those links above!) so it wouldn’t make sense to beat a dead horse here. Suffice it to say that deliberate practice is something you must do in order to achieve time-efficient improvements in whatever fields are relevant to your life. In fact, participating in deliberate practice is such a strong predictor of success in a variety of athletic and intellectual fields (even chess!) that it has been called an “unfair advantage.” Needless to say, at this blog, we try to deploy the maximum possible quantity of unfair advantages in your favor. </p>

<p>Let’s construct a short working definition of deliberate practice by examining its attributes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>DP is goal driven, ie. is working towards some objective (bowling 70 km per hour in cricket consistently/learning 100 Pashto words per week/whatever)</li>
  <li>DP involves breaking complex tasks down into tiny, mechanical chunks that <a href="/things-that-take-no-talent">require no talent</a> ie. 1) Sit in your chair in a silent room, 2) load Rosetta Stone software, 3) Repeat Pashto phrases back to the computer for 1 hour, etc. Each of those could easily be done by a very stupid person, who would balk utterly if I commanded him to “Learn Pashto!”</li>
  <li>DP is repeatable, ie. you can come back tomorrow and learn more Pashto vocabulary using the same (sit » load software » repeat words) algorithm as you used today</li>
  <li>DP involves a tight iterative feedback loop, where good or bad outcomes are connected to your actions in near real time. For example, the Rosetta Stone software will grade your pronunciation as soon as you finish talking.</li>
  <li>DP is difficult</li>
</ul>

<p>Deliberate practice is one of this blog’s foundational ideas, and I return to it with a tiresome frequency—so apologies in advance for standing on my soapbox.</p>

<p>In a way, DP is a method for standardizing disparate problem domains. Rather than discovering a new meta-method for every sphere of your life, you can try to make the problem fit a DP shaped mold. Do you need to learn node.js for a project at work? </p>

<ul>
  <li>Find a practice problem that you can solve in Node
    <ul>
      <li>Goal = Use node.js to display the average temperature in London each day on a computer screen</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Break this goal into little chunks. Steps =
    <ul>
      <li>Learn to display “Hello World” on a computer screen</li>
      <li>Find a data source for the temperature. Maybe Her Majesty’s weather service, or weather.com?</li>
      <li>Learn to perform addition and division in Node</li>
      <li>Use addition and division operations at the same time to calculate the average temperature</li>
      <li>Employ each of the previous steps in a single program</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Scale up and repeat
    <ul>
      <li>Now show a timeseries plot of London’s temperature.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Carefully observe the code’s failures and successes. Make note of approaches that did and didn’t work for future use.</li>
  <li>Be prepared for difficulty</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Out of the box, you will suck at a lot of things. It is your job to regard this as a temporary state of affairs <em>that you can consciously take steps to fix</em>. </p>

<!--more-->

<p>If this blog can only convince you of a single thing, make it this one. It is vitally, crucially important that you avoid the stagnation mindset. View your present condition not as an end or event, but rather as the starting point for a process of improvement. Train yourself to reason about <em>skills that can be learned</em> instead of <em>aptitudes</em> or <em>talents.</em> Locating reverse gear in a standard-transmission Volkswagen in the dark? That sounds like a learnable skill that could be improved with careful practice! Juggling four beanbags at the same time, so as to entertain one’s children? Definitely a learnable skill. Persuading your boss to give you a raise? Often viewed as an aptitude/luck, but in fact eminently learnable.</p>

<p>In sports, in business, in academics, in the fine art of womanizing, and in matters of character, you must take steps to improve your skills, knowledge, and position. </p>

<p>But not just any steps—you need to find out the single canonically best way to improve in your discipline, and then focus your efforts on that. The <a href="/blog/2014/11/14/deliberate-practice/">deliberate practice</a> post talks more about that, and I encourage you to read it. But this post isn’t really about any specific meta-problem-solving algorithm. Rather, it is focused on the mindset of seeing <em>solvable problems</em> of design and implementation everywhere you look and <em>regarding your current reality as a starting point.</em></p>

<p><blockquote><p>kai · zen<br/>noun<br/>a business philosophy or system that is based on making positive changes on a regular basis</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Warning! This mindset will bring the haters out of the woodwork. Otherwise agreeable people, your friends, lovers, and acquaintances, will suddenly narrow their eyes and regard you with suspicion. People don’t like change, and they especially don’t like change that leaves them behind. They will try to tear you down, imply that things are perfectly fine as-is, and cast thinly-veiled aspersions upon the likelihood of your success. Be prepared to ignore this and keep going.</p>

<p>When you commit to this mindset, it is scary for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You are going to be wrong. </li>
  <li>You are going to admit that you are wrong (loudly).</li>
</ol>

<p>If you’re a millenial, that latter point is particularly terrifying. But stick with me—this is a solvable problem and we can sort it out. (See what I did there?) In fact, you will very likely learn to love the moment when you discover that you were wrong. Once your ego is out of the way, you can view the negatives in the training set as a shortcut to mastery—instead of getting unhelpful ambiguous feedback from the world, you have now learned what not to do, and can make changes accordingly to start dominating. </p>

<h2 id="an-example-from-sports-training">An example from sports training:</h2>
<p>A wide variety of skill levels are represented on the average childrens’ cricket team. The stronger, taller nine-year old bowlers have a seemingly unassailable advantage. And for a few seasons, it looks as though the scrawnier players are doomed to cricket careers spent on the sidelines of the pitch. </p>

<p>But if you spend enough time involved with childrens’ cricket, either officiating, spectating, or coaching, you’ll start to see a pattern. Those seemingly unassailable early-growth-spurt bowlers become accustomed to the trappings of effortless success. Their superior size, speed, and strength renders them complacent, and they learn that they don’t need to apply themselves to the business of sound fundamentals, skill building, or technique. Worse yet, these large, strong players tend to have a “biggest gorilla around” attitude, wherein they develop a know-it-all, senior-member-of-the-team persona. This persona invariably inhibits further technique growth and diminishes coachability.</p>

<p>Surround your pullquote like this {&#8221; text to be quoted &#8220;}</p>

<p>And a funny thing happens as time passes. Before long, the technical advantages of careful study, coachability, and the “I am a beginner” mindset have compounded. The large children, the former stars, are still performing at the same level of fundamentals as they were three seasons ago, and their output has risen slightly, perhaps linearly, as they develop musculature and coordination. But some of the little guys are starting to reach the “hockey stick” region of their player-development curve, and in the space of a few months they can develop into extremely performant players. Invariably, the most valuable players on an Upper Sixth form cricket team—around 18 years of age—are either A) in the 1% of most physically gifted athletes or B) extremely coachable former weaklings. Needless to say, the intersection of A and B is where great bowlers are made. But one cannot change one’s innate talents, and since this is a blog about self-actualization, it is best to focus on the latter case for all practical purposes.</p>

<p>At any rate, the moral of the story is that in childrens’ cricket and many other fields, dilligence and malleability trump inborn talent and static advantages. It behooves you to behave like the scrappy little guy, and to avoid at any cost the mentality and behavior of the stagnant former starring batsmen. And furthermore, I suggest that you carefully direct your efforts at self improvement, perhaps by reading the discussion of <a href="/blog/2014/11/14/deliberate-practice/">deliberate practice</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Napoleon said something like (paraphrasing aggressively here), “The results of every battle are determined ahead of time by the geography, weather, and factors pertaining to the supply of war <em>materiel</em>.” </p>

<p>This notion of meta-factors’ outsized importance also applies to studying, especially in college.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>When you are studying hard, your brain will become attuned to small details. It is best to point this detail-oriented focus at the text you’re trying to learn, such as Andrew Ng’s <a href="http://www.holehouse.org/mlclass/">Machine Learning course</a> or one of my personal favorite MOOC’s, <em>The Theory and Practice of Dodge Diesel Truck Repair for Strongly Heteronormative Men.</em></p>

<p>In most candidate study locations, there will be a million small distractions that, when compounded, will significantly diminish your focus. Do not waste your mental <em>oomph</em> on small blinking lights on the back of an HP Elitebook’s NIC, loud IT managers, people walking in your field of view, etc. It is <em>so important</em> to find somewhere with very few audiovisual distractions, where you know you can be productive. </p>

<p>Instead of taking the first seat in the library that comes into view, you ought to find the single canonically best place to study, and then study there every single time.</p>
