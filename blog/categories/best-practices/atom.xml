    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let’s imagine a situation: You have </p>

<p>Stackable permament life improvements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learning a new language (Russian, Pashto, pig latin)</li>
  <li>Buying assets that will appreciate or throw off positive cash flows indefinitely (bonds, equities, real estate, whatever).</li>
  <li>You gain experience talking to pretty girls, such that you give off a jaded and experienced vibe and are not intimidated by the next Finnish model you talk to.</li>
  <li>You learn a new skill, such as how to squat with good form. This will allow you to improve your fitness indefinitely in the future.</li>
  <li>You learn new theory that deepens your understanding of the world. Example: You read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Applied-Partial-Differential-Equations-Boundary/dp/0130652431">Haberman</a>’s book on partial differential equations. Now you can apply this theory to a more fundamental understanding of heat transfer and wave phenomena while surfing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Non Permanent life improvements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You buy a delicious cake from the bakery and eat it. It is tasty at the time but if you want to get that taste again, you’ll have to buy another one</li>
  <li>You spend time playing Halo, which is very enjoyable but doesn’t pay dividends beyond slightly improved hand-eye coordination down the road</li>
</ul>

<p>Stackable permanent life improvements tend to fall into a few buckets: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Learning new stuff, such as practical skills or theories</li>
  <li>Financial improvements (new investments or appreciating/cash flow positive property)</li>
  <li>Gaining credentials, such as degrees or fellowships, that can be used to convince other people and The Establishment of your value</li>
</ul>

<p>When choosing how to spend your time/money/other scarce resources, it is best to lean towards stackable permanent life improvements. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In many college classes and in the knowledge-work industry, you will be required to learn new material from a book. Very likely you will be assigned some reading on the topic, and this reading will probably be from an eminent and respectable tome. When people see you carrying around that tome, or reading it on the tube, they will be quite impressed by your powerful brain. But there’s one large drawback.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Surround your pullquote like this {&#8221; text to be quoted &#8220;}</p>

<p>Nobody will be impressed in the slightest when they see you carrying that around. In fact, you’ll likely be mocked. For this reason, your manager will never hand you a <em>For Dummies</em> or similar title after asking you to figure out a new topic—it would imply that his company is filled with wankers. Not one professor in all of academia has ever assigned a <em>Complete Idiot’s Guide.</em> But these books are often the most valuable introductory material available anywhere. They assume no prior domain knowledge, tend to treat each chapter as a discrete unit that could be learned alone, are written with many concrete examples, and often include bits of levity to ease the burden of the material’s density.</p>

<p>Most students feel guilty for ignoring the assigned course text. I hereby give you permission to ignore bad academic material and to make your own decisions about how to optimize learning outcomes. Next time you’re assigned some dense reading, check to see if you can find a more accessible treatment at one of the following locations or elsewhere:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Dummies">For Dummies</a>, written in a cutesy tone but often quite valuable</li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_Idiot%27s_Guides">Complete Idiot’s guide</a>, similarly cutesy, often with groan-inducing humor</li>
  <li><a href="http://betterexplained.com">Better Explained</a>, which is pure gold</li>
  <li><a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/v/very-short-introductions-vsi/?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">The Very Short Introduction Series</a>, written in a more academic style but generally quite accessible</li>
  <li><a href="https://georgemdallas.wordpress.com/2014/05/14/wavelets-4-dummies-signal-processing-fourier-transforms-and-heisenberg/">George M. Dallas</a>, who covers only a handful of technical topics, but does so masterfully.</li>
</ul>

<p>Caveat: This advice is for the mere mortals who are getting by on elbow grease and long hours. Obviously this does not apply if you’re a top-5% theoretical thinker. You know who you are. Why are you reading this blog? Go forth and conquer that <a href="http://maths.anu.edu.au/math3349-special-topics-mathematics-differential-geometry">special topics seminar in differential geometry</a>. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Continuing yesterday’s treatment of <a href="http://bro-kaizen.github.io/blog/2014/11/16/on-gumption-and-character/">gumption and character</a>, it’s time to explicitly highlight an important caveat: Gumption can be depleted! And here too is a chance to connect with Bro Kaizen’s favorite soapbox topic, <a href="http://bro-kaizen.github.io/blog/2014/11/14/deliberate-practice/">Deliberate Practice</a>. </p>

<p>Deliberate Practice has 3 inputs:</p>

<!--more-->

<ol>
  <li>Time</li>
  <li>Knowledge</li>
  <li>Gumption</li>
</ol>

<p>Ingredient #1, time management, has been abundantly covered by <a href="http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/08/07/on-time-management/">far</a> <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/220418">greater</a> <a href="http://blog.penelopetrunk.com/2009/01/08/5-time-management-tricks-i-learned-from-years-of-hating-tim-ferriss/">powers</a> than Bro Kaizen. Ingredient #2 has been treated elsewhere, <a href="http://bro-kaizen.github.io/blog/2014/11/12/growth-mentality/">on</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck">off</a> this blog. Let’s focus on ingredient #3, “Gumption.”</p>

<p>If you expend your gumption fruitlessly, by hours spent copy-and-pasting long columns of figures between Excel spreadsheets, or memorizing vast quantities of facts by rote, you will lack the wherewithal to tackle the design-a-rocket-thruster project when it is offered to you. Similarly, in your drained state, you’ll lack the discipline to stick to your diet, wake up early to visit the gym, man up and go talk to that pretty girl, and avoid the time-wasting temptation of Reddit/Television. Resistance to each of these negative life ingredients draws from the same reservoir.</p>

<p>Therefore you must husband your gumption reserves, protect them from depletion on stupid things, and instead expend them solely on deliberate practice and worthwhile tasks (aka rocket engine design). Perhaps the most practical way to accomplish this gumption husbandry is to construct a “life system” wherein positive processes and outcomes happen by default. For example,</p>

<ul>
  <li>Design a trip to the gym into your day (perhaps by joining one between your house and job, such that you pass it every day anyway and you might as well go in). </li>
  <li>Put a pullup bar in your bathroom door so you end up doing a few reps on your way to the shower. (Idea stolen from <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/hacking-strength/">Matt Might</a>)</li>
  <li>Pay your housemate to withold your wallet and phone every day after work until you complete your 1 hour of Pashto language practice.</li>
</ul>

<p>We want the <em>system</em> to do the heavy motivational lifting/tiresome shlepping automatically, thereby freeing your gumption reservoir for the vital tasks in which it is on the critical path or this the limiting reactant. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wiser and more experienced writers than Bro Kaizen are considering Deliberate Practice, about which topic we began <a href="http://bro-kaizen.github.io/blog/2014/11/14/deliberate-practice/">harping</a> earlier this week. Here’s perhaps the pithiest example of DP yet—this is the whole thing in a nutshell.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><blockquote><p>Consider the activity of two basketball players practicing free throws for one hour. Player A shoots 200 practice shots, Player B shoots 50. The Player B retrieves his own shots, dribbles leisurely and takes several breaks to talk to friends. Player A has a colleague who retrieves the ball after each attempt. The colleague keeps a record of shots made. If the shot is missed the colleague records whether the miss was short, long, left or right and the shooter reviews the results after every 10 minutes of practice. To characterize their hour of practice as equal would hardly be accurate. Assuming this is typical of their practice routine and they are equally skilled at the start, which would you predict would be the better shooter after only 100 hours of practice?</p><footer><strong>—Aubrey Daniels</strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>The quote is brazenly stolen from <a href="http://aubreydaniels.com/pmezine/expert-performance-apologies-dr-ericsson-it-not-10000-hours-deliberate-practice">here</a>. Written glibly like this, Aubrey and I are making it sound easy, when in fact the essence of the thing is just precisely the opposite. Of course Deliberate Practice is not easy—<em>that’s the point.</em> It’s hard. And it is for that reason that you must <a href="http://bro-kaizen.github.io/blog/2014/11/17/husband-your-gumption/">nurture</a> your supply of <a href="http://bro-kaizen.github.io/blog/2014/11/16/on-gumption-and-character/">gumption</a> in order to tackle it. </p>

    <id>http://bro-kaizen.github.io/blog/2014/11/14/deliberate-practice</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’re overweight, you don’t earn physical fitness by spending three days doing a cardio circuit with your roomate, two days following a diet that your girlfriend invented, four days with Mark Rippetoe’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rippetoe">Starting Strength</a>, and then going to sit on the couch. A piecemeal (and half-heartedly implemented) approach like that is <strong>destined to fail.</strong></p>

<p>But fear not—there is a better way:</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The better approach is called “deliberate practice,” a term that I have shamelessly stolen from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Colvin">Geoff Colvin</a>, <a href="http://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice">James Clear</a>, and <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2010/11/07/the-secret-of-great-men-deliberate-practice/">others</a>. </p>

<p>Deliberate practice has been exhaustively defined and elaborated upon elsewhere (there are literally books written on the topic—follow those links above!) so it wouldn’t do to beat a dead horse at length here. Suffice it to say that deliberate practice is something you must do in order to achieve time-efficient improvements in whatever fields are relevant to your life. In fact, participating in deliberate practice is such a strong predictor of success in a variety of athletic and intellectual fields (even chess!) that it has been called an “unfair advantage.” Needless to say, at this blog, we try to deploy the maximum possible quantity of unfair advantages in your favor. </p>

<p>Let’s construct a short working definition of deliberate practice by examining its attributes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>DP is goal driven, ie. is working towards some objective (bowling 70 km per hour in cricket consistently/learning 100 Pashto words per week/whatever)</li>
  <li>DP involves breaking complex tasks down into tiny, mechanical chunks that <a href="/things-that-take-no-talent">require no talent</a> ie. 1) Sit in your chair in a silent room, 2) load Rosetta Stone software, 3) Repeat Pashto phrases back to the computer for 1 hour, etc. Each of those could easily be done by a very stupid person, who would balk utterly if I commanded him to “Learn Pashto!”</li>
  <li>DP is repeatable, ie. you can come back tomorrow and learn more Pashto vocabulary using the same (sit » load software » repeat words) algorithm as you used today</li>
  <li>DP involves a tight iterative feedback loop, where good or bad outcomes are connected to your actions in near real time. For example, the Rosetta Stone software will grade your pronunciation as soon as you finish talking.</li>
  <li>DP is difficult</li>
</ul>

<p>In a way, DP is a method for standardizing disparate problem domains. Rather than discovering a new meta-method for improvements in each sphere of your life, you can try to make the problem fit a DP shaped mold. If you need to learn node.js for a project at work, you might read about DP and then try to approach the problem like this: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Find a practice problem that you can solve in Node
    <ul>
      <li>Goal = Use node.js to display the average temperature in London each day on a computer screen</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Break this goal into little chunks. Steps =
    <ul>
      <li>Learn to display “Hello World” on a computer screen</li>
      <li>Find a data source for the temperature. Maybe Her Majesty’s weather service, or weather.com?</li>
      <li>Learn to perform addition and division in Node</li>
      <li>Use addition and division operations at the same time to calculate the average temperature</li>
      <li>Employ each of the previous steps in a single program</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Scale up and repeat
    <ul>
      <li>Now show a timeseries plot of London’s temperature.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Carefully observe the code’s failures and successes. Make note of approaches that did and didn’t work for future use.</li>
  <li>Be prepared for difficulty</li>
</ul>
