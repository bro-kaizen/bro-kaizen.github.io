    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;re overweight, you don&rsquo;t earn physical fitness by spending three days doing a cardio circuit with your roomate, two days following a diet that your girlfriend invented, four days with Mark Rippetoe&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rippetoe">Starting Strength</a>, and then going to sit on the couch. A piecemeal (and half-heartedly implemented) approach like that is <strong>destined to fail.</strong></p>

<p>A much better approach is &ldquo;deliberate practice,&rdquo; a term that I have shamelessly stolen from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Colvin">Geoff Colvin</a>, <a href="http://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice">James Clear</a>, and <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2010/11/07/the-secret-of-great-men-deliberate-practice/">others</a>.</p>

<p>Deliberate practice has been exhaustively defined and elaborated upon elsewhere (there are literally books written on the topic&mdash;follow those links above!) so it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to beat a dead horse here. Suffice it to say that deliberate practice is something you must do in order to achieve time-efficient improvements in whatever fields are relevant to your life. In fact, participating in deliberate practice is such a strong predictor of success in a variety of athletic and intellectual fields (even chess!) that it has been called an &ldquo;unfair advantage.&rdquo; Needless to say, at this blog, we try to deploy the maximum possible quantity of unfair advantages in your favor.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s construct a short working definition of deliberate practice by examining its attributes:</p>

<ul>
<li>DP involves breaking complex tasks down into tiny, mechanical chunks that <a href="/things-that-take-no-talent">require no talent</a> ie. 1) Sit in your chair in a silent room, 2) load Rosetta Stone software, 3) Repeat Pashto phrases back to the computer for 1 hour, etc. Each of those could easily be done by a very stupid person, who would balk utterly if I commanded him to &ldquo;Learn Pashto!&rdquo;</li>
<li>DP is goal driven, ie. is working towards some objective (bowling 70 km per hour in cricket consistently/learning 100 Pashto words per week/whatever)</li>
<li>DP is repeatable, ie. you can come back tomorrow and learn more Pashto vocabulary using the same (sit >> load software >> repeat words) algorithm as you used today</li>
<li>DP involves a tight iterative feedback loop, where good or bad outcomes are connected to your actions in near real time. For example, the Rosetta Stone software will grade your pronunciation as soon as you finish talking.</li>
<li>DP is difficult</li>
</ul>


<p>This last point is most relevant to this post.
DP has 2 inputs:</p>

<ol>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Gumption</li>
</ol>


<p>Therefore you must husband your gumption reserves, protect them from depletion on stupid things, and instead expend them solely on deliberate practice.</p>

<p>Ultimately this is a post about building a system where the desireable outcomes happen by default. Design a trip to the gym into your day by signing up for one that is between your house and job. Put a pullup bar in your bathroom door so you end up doing a few reps on your way to the shower. Pay your buddy to hold your wallet and phone until you complete your 1 hour of Russian language practice.</p>
