    <content type="html"><![CDATA[A civilization is neither a country's land and soil, nor its built environment of skyscrapers and bridges, nor its laws written on paper. Civilizations are always and everywhere made of *people.* And consequently, if you *remove* the people from a country, you will inevitably *remove* their civilization along with them.

## I. On the Composition of Civilization

Similarly, if you *replace* those original people with others, you inexorably *replace* the civilization itself. The land and soil will remain, and for a time also the buildings and perhaps even the law books. Maybe the country&#8217;s name will persist. But the *civilization* will be gone. 

Let&#8217;s conduct a thought experiment. Imagine a situation where the entire population of Japan disappeared from their islands, perhaps because a terrible disease rendered Japan uninhabitable. And the disease persists there such that no new people can take the departed Japanese&#8217; places. Would you ever say that &#8220;Japanese civilization continues in Tokyo?&#8221; Of course not &#8212; because *there are no Japanese people in Tokyo.* It&#8217;s just a bunch of buildings, not a civilization. The law books still exist in the law libraries, and the mountains and rivers are all precisely where they&#8217;ve always been. But that ineffable magic that makes a society has vanished. 

Now adjust the thought experiment slightly. Instead of merely removing the Japanese, replace them one-for-one with Sioux Indians from North America. Would you now say that &#8220;Japanese civilization continues in Tokyo?&#8221; Again, of course not. That would be a preposterous claim. Something would be happening on the islands we call Japan, and perhaps we could even call it a civilization, but it would certainly not be *Japanese* civilization. 

Let&#8217;s adjust the thought experiment further still, by replacing only N% of the Japanese with Sioux Indians. For N = 0% replacement, it&#8217;s obvious that the thing happening in the Japanese islands is inarguably *Japanese Civilization*. Conversely, at N = 100% replacement (aka the case above) it&#8217;s obviously *not* Japanese Civilization. As we increase N, we find a hybrid civilization, with some Japanese characteristics, and some non-Japanese characteristics. At some point, we&#8217;ll pass a critical threshold, what&#8217;s called in the layman&#8217;s literature a &#8220;tipping point,&#8221; beyond which Japanese civilization has ceased to recognizably exist as such. 

The critical premise of Ethno-Nationalism in all its incarnations is that the threshold value of N should be identified (noting it likely varies per-civilization) and not exceeded. Of course, some incarnations are more controversial than others. We&#8217;ve chosen Japan as an example here because in Japan, it&#8217;s a mainstream idea that Japan should remain substantially Japanese. And in fact even the smuggest and most sanctimonious social-justice types in New York and Seattle don&#8217;t particularly oppose this idea. Similarly, it&#8217;s quite rare to hear an objection to the idea that Libya or Ghana ought to remain Libyan and Ghanaian.

But if you swap Japan for a country in the White man&#8217;s homeland, you&#8217;ll suddenly meet terrifyingly virulent resistance from many quarters. We leave it as an exercise for the reader to examine why this is so.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Opinions abound about the nature of the "alt-right," often written across a yawning chasm of cultural misunderstanding. This post presents two potentially novel angles. 

<!--more-->

## I. The Alt-Right as an Aesthetic Movement

The Alt-Right is perhaps best understood as an *aesthetic* movement, not a political one. That is, the Alt-Right&#8217;s trademark politics arose as a *consequence* of its aesthetics. Breathless writers have spilled much ink about the Alt-Right&#8217;s meme-based iconography; but focussing on the cartoon frogs is a mistake. Unlike previous aesthetic movements, which were concerned with art, architecture, or industrial design, the Alt-Right chooses *women&#8217;s bodies* as its aesthetic object. 

It is a movement rooted in the slow realization that feminism and related leftist-themed ideologies do not produce slender, beautiful, long-haired, well-behaved, demure females. Instead, those ideologies produce Lena Dunham. Ms. Dunham and her ilk are an aesthetic and behavioral anathema to any man with an ounce of self respect, equipped as they are with tattoos, short hair, high bodyfat, and unpleasant attitudes. 

This strong revulsion galvanized male opposition to whatever ideology produced the Dunhamite women. The Alt-Right could only have emerged in a world of ascendant Feminism (and sibling ideologies), in which Dunham and her admiring imitators were abundantly present and observable. The movement&#8217;s key premise is that female aesthetics covary with the political zeitgeist &#8212; it&#8217;s no cooincidence that American women have been getting fatter and less feminine precisely as Leftist ideologies have taken hold. Therefore, the Alt-Right seeks to rehabilitate the West&#8217;s political zeitgeist in order to return to a world with abundant supplies of sexy, slender, well-behaved women. 

It&#8217;s no cooincidence that the Alt-Right grew from, and is at least partially related to, the &#8220;pickup artist&#8221; phenomenon, in which men attempt to bed women, and become in the process keenly attuned to the many permutations of the female form. Many canonical Alt-Right sites were originally pickup-oriented, and only later refocussed to political matters. 

This is also why the Alt-Right includes so many young White men &#8212; their natural mates are young White women, which is precisely the demographic where the Leftist ideological effects are strongest, and where the disfigured aesthetics are most noticeable. 


## II. The Alt-Right as an Anticolonial Insurgency

Let&#8217;s also examine the Alt-Right as a classical anticolonial insurgency. Consider the parallels between a classic anticolonial insurgency &#8212; take South Africa as a convenient example &#8212; and the current situation in Western Europe or North America. Each case involves a foreign people, imported into a host country in large numbers, and changing that host country&#8217;s ethnic balance and cultural norms. 

Historically, the invaders were White Europeans, since their societies were the only ones with sufficient technological and social advancement to project power overseas. But now the White Man&#8217;s elites have sold him out, and are importing a new occupying band of settlers to fuel their population-growth-dependent economies. The new settlers in White Europe are dark skinned and often Muslim; in North America they come in a thousand varieties. But unlike the White man&#8217;s Colonialism, the new settlers&#8217; homelands have never indigenously developed a high-trust society with a middle class.

So the colonizers have become the colonized, and the Alt-Right is both borrowing old tricks (distinctive visual propaganda style, public demonstration and protest) from historical anticolonial movements, and also inventing some of its own (faux-hokey propaganda tone, internet-enabled decentralization). 

Perhaps the best analogue is the native Xhosa resistance and backlash against the Xhosa elites as they made land deals with the British. The difference, of course, is that the British brought modern indoor living and high-trust societies with a middle class to Africa. Symmetrically, when Africa comes to Britain, precisely the reverse will occur.
