    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Let’s imagine a situation: You have </p>

<p>Stackable permament life improvements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learning a new language (Russian, Pashto, pig latin)</li>
  <li>Buying assets that will appreciate or throw off positive cash flows indefinitely (bonds, equities, real estate, whatever).</li>
  <li>You gain experience talking to pretty girls, such that you give off a jaded and experienced vibe and are not intimidated by the next Finnish model you talk to.</li>
  <li>You learn a new skill, such as how to squat with good form. This will allow you to improve your fitness indefinitely in the future.</li>
  <li>You learn new theory that deepens your understanding of the world. Example: You read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Applied-Partial-Differential-Equations-Boundary/dp/0130652431">Haberman</a>’s book on partial differential equations. Now you can apply this theory to a more fundamental understanding of heat transfer and wave phenomena while surfing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Non Permanent life improvements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You buy a delicious cake from the bakery and eat it. It is tasty at the time but if you want to get that taste again, you’ll have to buy another one</li>
  <li>You spend time playing Halo, which is very enjoyable but doesn’t pay dividends beyond slightly improved hand-eye coordination down the road</li>
</ul>

<p>Stackable permanent life improvements tend to fall into a few buckets: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Learning new stuff, such as practical skills or theories</li>
  <li>Financial improvements (new investments or appreciating/cash flow positive property)</li>
  <li>Gaining credentials, such as degrees or fellowships, that can be used to convince other people and The Establishment of your value</li>
</ul>

<p>When choosing how to spend your time/money/other scarce resources, it is best to lean towards stackable permanent life improvements. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In many college classes and in the knowledge-work industry, you will be required to learn new material from a book. Very likely you will be assigned some reading on the topic, and this reading will probably be from an eminent and respectable tome. When people see you carrying around that tome, or reading it on the tube, they will be quite impressed by your powerful brain. But there’s one large drawback.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Continuing yesterday’s treatment of <a href="http://bro-kaizen.github.io/blog/2014/11/16/on-gumption-and-character/">gumption and character</a>, it’s time to explicitly highlight an important caveat: Gumption can be depleted! And here too is a chance to connect with Bro Kaizen’s favorite soapbox topic, <a href="http://bro-kaizen.github.io/blog/2014/11/14/deliberate-practice/">Deliberate Practice</a>. </p>

<p>Deliberate Practice has 3 inputs:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Gumption is the gasoline of man’s life. It is the get-up-and-go, the stick-to-it-iveness, and the knocked-down-twice, stand-up-thrice fire inside you. If you run out of it, things will head south very quickly. You must cultivate this gumption, nurture it, and encourage it to grow. Every man possesses by nature a certain rate of gumption replenishment, which rate may be modified by nurture. As you nurture your rate of gumption replenishment, you will also tend to develop in parallel the ability to store more of it. I know of at least two ways to develop gumption:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wiser and more experienced writers than Bro Kaizen are considering Deliberate Practice, about which topic we began <a href="http://bro-kaizen.github.io/blog/2014/11/14/deliberate-practice/">harping</a> earlier this week. Here’s perhaps the pithiest example of DP yet—this is the whole thing in a nutshell.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’re overweight, you don’t earn physical fitness by spending three days doing a cardio circuit with your roomate, two days following a diet that your girlfriend invented, four days with Mark Rippetoe’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rippetoe">Starting Strength</a>, and then going to sit on the couch. A piecemeal (and half-heartedly implemented) approach like that is <strong>destined to fail.</strong></p>

<p>This notion of meta-factors’ outsized importance also applies to studying, especially in college.</p>
