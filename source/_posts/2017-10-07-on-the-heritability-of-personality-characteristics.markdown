Observation about the world:
 
Some peoples have constructed high-trust societies with a middle class, while others have not. For example, the Japanese, the British, and the Israelis have done so. Conversely, there exist no recorded examples of Africans constructing a high-trust society with a middle class. 

This obvious and easily observable truth makes Bro Kaizen feel somewhat uncomfortable

* Construct a diagnostic test which can evaluate a human's personality characteristics. There are several implementations of this already, e.g. the Big 5, Hexaco, etc. 

* Different people will have different personality characteristics and will therefore receive different scores on your diagnostic test.

* You can divide a population into subgroups and aggregate their scores within each subgroup, perhaps by e.g. averaging or similar procedures. 

* We can plot our scores on some sort of chart. For example, Big 5 diagnostic charts look like Fig. 1; other tests are amenable to similar charting. Of course you can plot on a single chart either one person's results or an aggregation of several people's results.

* There are of course an infinite number of grouping schemes by which to divide the population into subgroups. For instance, you could group together everyone who's name starts with the letter "S," and average their scores. Or alternately, you could group together everyone who enjoys ice cream, and average their scores. 

* Some of these grouping schemes are meaningful, and many others are not. The two examples given above are likely non-meaningful.

* Within a given grouping scheme, each subgroup's personality scores will in general differ from one another, some to a statistically significant extent, and others not. For example, we'd not likely expect to find significant differences between the personalities of people who's names begin with "R" and "S." But we'd be very surprised to find no differences between the personalities of a group of convicted serial killers and a control group of ordinary people. 

* Despite the relentless protests to the contrary by the so called "Equalist" political factions, race and gender are two highly-meaningful grouping schemes. 

* As a thought experiment, imagine we perform the procedure above for everyone on earth, plotting everyone's personality diagnostic results with a single dot. We could assign a color to each race --- the Japanese might be represented by a blue dot, Ashkenazi Jews by a green dot, and White people with a red one. 

* We'd then find the Japanese clustered in one region of the chart, the Jews in another region, with White people in yet still another. Of course there would be outliers and perhaps even sub-clusters, corresponding to sub-populations such as Scandinavians or Irishmen. But in general we'll find
