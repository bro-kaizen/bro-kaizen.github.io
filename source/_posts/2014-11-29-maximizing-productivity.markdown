When you are studying hard, your brain will become attuned to small details. It is best to point this detail-oriented focus at the text you're trying to learn, such as Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning course](http://www.holehouse.org/mlclass/) or The Theory and Practice of Dodge Diesel Truck Repair. Do not waste your focus on small blinking lights on the back of an HP Elitebook's NIC, loud IT managers, people walking in your field of view, etc. This is why it is _so important_ to find somewhere with very few audiovisual distractions, where you know you can be productive. You ought to find the single canonically best place to study, and then go there every time you can.
